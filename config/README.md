# Quick-Start

For simple setups you only need to edit jmeter.sh.inc, which is self-documented.

# Advanced Instructions

You can always reset your configuration easily. Just make a copy of the distributed config-files. To do so, run the following command in the project root:

```sh
cp -r config/dist/* config/
```

Then edit these files according to the setup guide (setup/README.md).
