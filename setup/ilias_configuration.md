# ILIAS Configuration for jMeter

The following ILIAS settings are recommended

* Deactivate the setting "users must change their password on first login" (can be reactivated once the jMeter users have logged in)
* Deactivate the user agreement (or login with the jMeter users and accept the agreement)

Optional:

* You might want to either disable the trash - or purge it from time to time.
